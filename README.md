# Godot Code Editor (WIP)
C++ and Rust Code editor made in Godot.

## Compiling
I hace only tested this on Windows, but un theory It should work on other systems
- Install Python and then Install scons
- Clone the [godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) repo and generate the bindings.
- Copy the repo to "addons/cpp_file_editor/Scripts" and open there a cmd/shell.
- Type "scons platform=Windows" without the quotes.

Open an issue if there are any problems or have a feature request.
