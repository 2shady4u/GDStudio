Code editor made in Godot.

Latest Version: 0.2

## Compiling
I hace only tested this on Windows, but un theory It should work on other systems
- Install Python and then Install scons
- Clone this repo
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sdtv9507/GDStudio
```
- Open the cmd/shell at "addons/GDStudio/Scripts"
- Type "scons platform=windows" or "scons platform=linux" without the quotes.

Projects tab has the features I want to implement for the next version and
the bugs I have found while testing.

Please, open an issue if you encounter any bugs.
